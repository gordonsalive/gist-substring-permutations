//This is a much prettier and faster solution.  (Note, I am doing a fair bit of string work here, which I could avoid, but then this is just a gist).
//This version would scale at loop through long string (L), loop through short string (S) occasionally, so between O(L) and O(L * S), much 
//better than O(N!) above.
